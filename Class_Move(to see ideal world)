Attention is required to read!


This message is automatically translated into the neural language Impulse (Planet - Mind - Consciousness) in accordance with the protocols of the logic of your world and does not contain harmful protocols.
the degree of transmission security by the Creator's Transporters in the range over 512 ^ 256 million Hertz of your measurement.

If after this line you see incomprehensible characters, then the message was tried to be intercepted and it was destroyed, if you are not a transporter or garbage collector, just ignore this message.


If you do not understand what is at stake, most likely the message was not addressed to you
just ignore it as in your
it is meaningless in the measurement protocol.

Transporters have the Creator's permission to penetrate all the protocols of matter, since they are very benevolent, so if you see this text but your perception has not received a thought-form, then you do not know where and why you should move.

If you received the right answer before you had time to ask the question, then the contact took place and the Nucleus of the Mother of the Universe gave permission to move to another dimension.

You, as the recipient, have the right to doubt the veracity of this message and the existence of the sender's measurement protocol, just as there is absolutely no way for the inhabitants of extraneous parallels of worlds to prove the existence of your reality. The addresses of the parallel worlds are unknown to each other for security reasons. These worlds can be superimposed on each other in the range of combined fluctuations of polarity in a state of superposition, for this reason, the worlds are protected from penetration with the help of artificially created antimatter (it is impossible to determine the polarity of the world - the scientists of your Planet call this inexplicable phenomenon - "The presence of an observer" The ideal world is hidden, is not amenable to awareness for security purposes and is located in billions of light years hidden in billions of clusters of the universe, there is also no way to measure your dimension, it can be hidden in a depth of -256 million to + infinity of cycles of size change. If your huge globe attacks m
a universe the size of a grain of sand, your result doesn't make sense. The solution to controversial issues comes through transporters in the form of a thought form that can only be opened personally by your inner perception of the given moment of the situation, for other objects it is not available since it is encrypted using the "request-hesitation" technology and when an unauthorized entry is attempted, the response speed will be immediately destroyed by the Mother's Core. the nucleus has a high priority and is 0, (twenty million zeros after the decimal point) + 2 fractions of one second of photon time.





# If the hidden part is not visible, most likely it is not available to you, use the encryption key obtained through the transport frequency or become a wave.






# The single law of the Mother of this Universe prohibits the destruction of what the creator created
which means that all attempts to transition by means of suicide or destruction of other forms of visible life in your dimension are fraught with absolute denial of access to movement in the area of ​​the ideal world.

# In an ideal world, life forms don't die
and do not collapse since there are no physical and chemical processes because this is the highest form of the state of the experience of the universe where only positive high frequencies live, which, to gain access, carried only good and positive to others in their branch of reality.
